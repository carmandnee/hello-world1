Markus Alexej Persson (Swedish: [ˈmarkɵs ˈpæːʂɔn] (About this sound listen); born 1 June 1979),[2] also known as Notch, is a Swedish video game programmer and designer. He is best known for creating the sandbox video game Minecraft, and for founding the video game company Mojang, alongside Carl Manneh and Jakob Porser, in late 2010.

Persson's principal venture for founding Mojang was Minecraft, which gained popularity and support since its tech demo in 2009.[3] Since the release of Minecraft, Persson has gained significant notability within the video game industry, having won multiple awards and establishing relations with the industry's figureheads.[4] Persson retained his position as the lead designer of Minecraft until the game's official launch in 2011, after which he transferred creative authority to Jens Bergensten.[5] In November 2014, he left Mojang after its acquisition by Microsoft.[6]
